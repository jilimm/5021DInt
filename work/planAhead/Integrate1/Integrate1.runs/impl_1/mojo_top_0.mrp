Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       188 out of   2,860    6%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          320
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           106 out of     320   33%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   5 out of     320    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         209 out of     320   65%
    Number of unique control sets:              12
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              57 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
